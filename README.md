# Serpinski Carpet

This is a C program that generates a Serpinski Carpet and saves it as a PPM image.

## Description

The Serpinski Carpet is a fractal pattern composed of filled and unfilled squares. This program generates a Serpinski Carpet using the provided C code and saves it as a PPM image file.

## Requirements

- C compiler
- `math.h` library

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/serpinski-carpet.git

2. Compile the code:

gcc serp_carpet.c -o serp_carpet -lm

3. Run the program:

./serp_carpet


4. After execution, the program will generate a file named `serp_carpet.ppm` which contains the Serpinski Carpet image.

## Example Output

Below is an example of a Serpinski Carpet generated by the program:

![Serpinski Carpet](serp_carpet.ppm)

## Parameters

The program uses the `ITER` constant to control the number of iterations for generating the Serpinski Carpet. Modify this value in the `serp_carpet.h` header file to adjust the level of detail in the generated image.
